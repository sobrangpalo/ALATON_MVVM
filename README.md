CODE
# ALATON Streetwear App (MVVM) 🚀
Hello! Since you are a student using an iPad, here is a quick guide on how this professional Android project works.

### 🛍️ Product Flow
This app follows a standard e-commerce flow:
1. **Authentication**: Users sign in or create a new account.
2. **Product Discovery**: View a curated list of streetwear from the ViewModel.
3. **Cart Management**: Add items to a reactive cart.
4. **Order Lifecycle**: Checkout to create an order, then manage its state (Pending → Received → Shipped).

### 🛠️ Language & Tech
- **Language**: **Kotlin** (The modern, safe, and preferred language for Android development).
- **Architecture**: **MVVM** (Model-View-ViewModel). This ensures the app is easy to test and maintain.
- **UI**: **XML** with ViewBinding for high-performance layouts.

### 💻 How to open in Android Studio
*Note: Android Studio requires a PC or Mac. Since you are on an iPad, you can use this web app to study the code, but to run it:*

1. Get to a computer with **Android Studio** installed.
